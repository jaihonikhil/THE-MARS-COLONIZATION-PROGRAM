Initiatives
------------

1. We have created a new heuristics which we have provided in the project by the name of Optimized Manhatten. Having tested the heuristic on benchmark, we have managed time reduction by approx 50% in case of Astar algorithm and approx 15% reduction in time in ____. The length of path and number of operations remain unaltered, hence we have not applied greedy algorithm to reduce time and compromise on the optimal path.
