Adding a list of possible innovations on which we plan to work: 

add penetrable weighted walls
entire screen covered problem - we may not be able to improve this because it is the standard property of the algorithm
visuals: divide into new sections of shortest path approach, least time
print no path possible
show all possible optimized paths when they are identical in values
add more heuristics
ML!!!
insert standard maze and patterns
add a tutorial in the start
